## Steps 
### Step 1: Create a new service principal
Navigate to a site collection in your tenant and generate a new client Id and Secret. (E.g https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx). In this page click Generate for both the Client Id, Client Secret Fields and supply the remaining fields. While you are developing the add-in ensure you use localhost.com including the port as the App Domain. You should have something similar as below.

### Step 2: Grant Tenant Permissions
In order to perform this step you must be a SharePoint Online Administrator. 

Navigate to your SharePoint Admin Center (E.g https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx) and grant the tenant permissions

Once you submitted the request for approval will be in a Pending Permission until the SharePoint Administrator or the App Catalog Administrator approves the request. To approve the request navigate to the app catalog, App Requests and approve the request.
